## Research Focus and Objectives

General Objective: To investigate the role of technology in driving economic growth in Kenya, with a specific focus on its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Specific Objectives:

To assess the impact of digital infrastructure investments (like mobile networks and internet connectivity) on Kenya's GDP growth from 2010 to 2025.

To evaluate the contribution of technology-driven sectors, including fintech and e-commerce, to job creation and GDP growth in Kenya over the past decade.

## Key Empirical Findings

Digital Infrastructure (Model 1): The analysis showed a positive association between mobile broadband subscriptions and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and GDP growth. However, the coefficient for ICT investment was unexpectedly negative.

Technology-Driven Sectors (Model 2):

Fintech (Mobile Money): Mobile money transaction volume was found to be highly significant and positive in driving job creation (4,130 additional jobs per KES 1 trillion increase in transactions).

E-commerce: The immediate effect of e-commerce on GDP and job creation was found to be non-significant in the model.

Urbanization: The study noted a negative significant effect of urbanization on job creation, suggesting disparities in job access, consistent with the digital divide.

## Conclusion and Policy Implications

Overall Conclusion: Technology significantly contributes to Kenya's economic growth, primarily through mobile broadband access, FDI, and the job-creating power of fintech.

Policy Recommendations: The study recommends that the government:

Strengthen digital infrastructure by expanding mobile broadband and attracting FDI.


Enhance the growth of the fintech and e-commerce sectors through incentives and potential tax reductions on transactions.

Address the digital divide by improving digital literacy and reducing the cost of smartphones and data, particularly in rural areas.
